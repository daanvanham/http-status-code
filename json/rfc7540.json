	//  4xx  -  User Error

	//   The 421 (Misdirected Request) status code indicates that the request was directed at a server that
	//  is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce
	//  responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI. Clients
	//  receiving a 421 (Misdirected Request) response from a server MAY retry the request - whether the
	//  request method is idempotent or not - over a different connection. This is possible if a connection
	//  is reused (Section 9.1.1) or if an alternative service is selected This status code MUST NOT be
	//  generated by proxies. A 421 response is cacheable by default, i.e., unless otherwise indicated by
	//  the method definition or explicit cache controls
