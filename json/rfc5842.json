	//  2xx  -  Successful

	//   The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid
	//  enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly. For each
	//  binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one will be reported with a 200 status,
	//  while subsequent DAV:response elements for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no
	//  DAV:response elements for their descendants are included.

	//  5xx  -  Server Error

	//   The 508 status code indicates that the server terminated an operation because it encountered an
	//  infinite loop while processing a request with 'Depth: infinity'. This status indicates that the
	//  entire operation failed.
