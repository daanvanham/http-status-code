//  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Status Code 308 (Permanent Redirect)
//  http://tools.ietf.org/html/7538

{
	//  3xx  -  Redirection

	//   The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new
	//  permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs.
	//  Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references to the effective
	//  request URI to one or more of the new references sent by the server, where possible. The server
	//  SHOULD generate a Location header field in the response containing a preferred URI reference for the
	//  new permanent URI. The user agent MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection. The
	//  server's response payload usually contains a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new
	//  URI(s). A 308 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method
	//  definition or explicit cache controls. Note: This status code is similar to 301 (Moved Permanently)
	//  except that it does not allow changing the request method from POST to GET.
