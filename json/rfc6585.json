{
	//  4xx  -  User Error

	//   The 428 status code indicates that the origin server requires the request to be conditional. Its
	//  typical use is to avoid the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies
	//  it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the
	//  server, leading to a conflict. By requiring requests to be conditional, the server can assure that
	//  clients are working with the correct copies. Responses using this status code SHOULD explain how to
	//  resubmit the request successfully. Responses with the 428 status code MUST NOT be stored by
	//  a cache.
	"428": "Precondition Required",

	//   The 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time
	//  ('rate limiting'). The response representations SHOULD include details explaining the condition, and
	//  MAY include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait before making a new request. Responses
	//  with the 429 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.
	"429": "Too Many Requests",

	//   The 431 status code indicates that the server is unwilling to process the request because its
	//  header fields are too large. The request MAY be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request
	//  header fields. It can be used both when the set of request header fields in total is too large, and
	//  when a single header field is at fault. In the latter case, the response representation SHOULD
	//  specify which header field was too large. Responses with the 431 status code MUST NOT be stored by
	//  a cache.
	"431": "Request Header Fields Too Large",

	//  5xx  -  Server Error

	//   The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access. The
	//  response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that allows the user to submit
	//  credentials (e.g., with an HTML form). Note that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or
	//  the login interface itself, because browsers would show the login interface as being associated with
	//  the originally requested URL, which may cause confusion. The 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by
	//  origin servers; it is intended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a means of
	//  controlling access to the network. Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by
	//  a cache.
	"511": "Network Authentication Required"
