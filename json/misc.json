	//  This status code indicates that the server is subject to legal restrictions which prevent it servicing
	//  the request. Since such restrictions typically apply to all operators in a legal jurisdiction, the
	//  server in question may or may not be an origin server. The restrictions typically most directly affect
	//  the operations of ISPs and search engines.
	//  Responses using this status code SHOULD include an explanation, in the response body, of the details of
	//  the legal restriction; which legal authority is imposing it, and what class of resources it applies to.
