	//  4xx  -  User Error

	//  This status code indicates that the server is subject to legal restrictions which prevent it
	//  servicing the request. Since such restrictions typically apply to all operators in a legal
	//  jurisdiction, the server in question may or may not be an origin server. The restrictions typically
	//  most directly affect the operations of ISPs and search engines. Responses using this status code
	//  SHOULD include an explanation, in the response body, of the details of the legal restriction; which
	//  legal authority is imposing it, and what class of resources it applies to.
