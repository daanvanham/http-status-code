	//  5xx  -  Server Error

	//   The policy for accessing the resource has not been met in the request. The server should send back
	//  all the information necessary for the client to issue an extended request. It is outside the scope
	//  of this specification to specify how the extensions inform the client. If the 510 response contains
	//  information about extensions that were not present in the initial request then the client MAY repeat
	//  the request if it has reason to believe it can fulfill the extension policy by modifying the request
	//  according to the information provided in the 510 response. Otherwise the client MAY present any
	//  entity included in the 510 response to the user, since that entity may include relevant
	//  diagnostic information.
